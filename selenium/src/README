Selenium Tests for flies

Please refer 
http://code.google.com/p/flies/wiki/WebTestWithSelenium
for latest documentation.

* Note: This README assumes you have at least basic knowledge of selenium,
        such as using Selenium IDE to edit, load, save test cases and test suites.
        Selenium server and browsers such as firefox and/or google-chrome should also be installed.

0. Glossaries:
   * Test Case: A list of selenium commands (selenese) that perform a certain action.
                e.g. Login, Logout, go to Japanese translation...
   * Test Suite: A list of test cases for performing a certain task.
   * Test Root: The directory that contains all the tests.
                By default, it is at the subdirectory "test-suites".
   * Privilege tests: Those tests require special care, thus are put in "privilege-test-suites".
   * Normal tests: Non-privilege related tests are deemed to be "normal test".

1. Normal test.
   1.a File naming convention.
      Test case and suite files should be named according to file naming convention,
      otherwise those test files won't be picked up by test system.
      * Test Case: A .html file that start with an English alphabet.
      * Test Suite: A .html file with the prefix "0-".
        The middle name will be use as test name.
        For example, name the suite "0-Tribe_JoinLeave.html",
        if the test name "Tribe_JoinLeave" is desired.

       It's recommended that a test suite and its corresponding test cases
       occupy their own directory. This directory should be under the test root.

       If the test suite is related to an issue, it's also good to include the issue number
       in the test suite name.

   1.b How to include a test suite.
      In flies, test suites are unit of testing.
      Following steps show how to make a test case.

   Step 0: Edit selenium/src/test.cfg to suit your own need.
           Some options are also overridable via environment variable, they are:
           BROWSERS_TO_TEST: browser to be used to preform the test.
                             Support value: firefox, googlechrome
                             Default value: firefox;googlechrome
           SELENIUM_SERVER_PORT: port for selenium server
                             Default value: 4444



   Step 1: Make a test suite and corresponding test cases in selenium IDE.
           Note that: test suites does not need to include login/logout functions,
                      because test system will add the them automatically.

   Step 2: In command line, run:
           ctest -V -s steer.cmake
           This will pick up all the test suites and start running tests.

2. Privilege tests
   Privilege tests are located in the directory privilege-test-suites.
   These test will be either be run as normal user and prelogin ( unlogined users),
   to see if they can access resources they should not be allowed to.

   2.a Type of privilege tests

       There are several types of privilege tests:

       HTTP404          URL that should return HTTP status 404 when visit.
       PERMISSION       URL that should be access only by admin.
       TEXT_PRESENT     Text to be shown.
       TEXT_NOT_PRESENT Text not to be shown.
       ELEM_PRESENT     Web element to be shown.
       ELEM_NOT_PRESENT Web element not to be shown.

   2.b File naming convention
     Test file should be named with "Issue<IssueNum>-TestName.suite".

   2.c File format
       Each .suite has 2 field, split by tab.
       First field is test types, list in 2.a,
       second filed is test data, it can be:
         URL exclude $FLIES_URL, for HTTP404 or PERMISSION
	 Text string for TEXT_PRESENT or TEXT_NOT_PRESENT
	 Selenium locator for ELEM_PRESENT and ELEM_NOT_PRESENT

       Each .suite can have one or more lines.
       '#' can be use to comment out lines.

   2.d Include and run test.
       Tests other than HTTP404 will be included in selenium tests,
       i.e. grab by
       ctest -V -s steer.cmake

       HTTP404 tests can be perform by running http404_check.sh
